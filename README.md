# [Notebook Application](https://vite-notebook.vercel.app)

Users can login with Google and create, read, update and delete (CRUD) their own notes. This application was created using React and the tools / libraries below: 

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the build tool / development enviroment.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for storing notes and user authentication.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment through GitHub.
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com)

## What I learned

- Supabase's database and authentication
- Configuring authentication with Google
- React Router v6 for a SPA
